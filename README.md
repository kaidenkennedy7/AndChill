AndChill is a full-stack application using **NodeJs**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** cloud services. Users can sign up for an account and then swipe on their favroite tv shows/movies which then save and can be viewed in their "preferences" tab on the account. 

In addition, users can share the socket.io link with friends/family to then see which programs they will "match" with in order to pick something to watch together.

Thanks to APIs from [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for providing movie and tv data as well as [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/) for providing watch-provider data. 

Users can: 
* pick which streaming service they would like to filter results by
* pick genres to filter results by
* view trailers of some movies/shows (if applicable)
* see ratings, runtimes/number of episodes, and view a small description of the content.

All of this is viewable on the swipe cards as well as under the matches and preferences tab.

### To Do List
* fix the swipe function on the cards via hammertime, they get stuck when viewing on mobile devices
